have -> attributes - is basically a variable associated with modelled object.
is_holding_plate = True
tables_responsible = [4, 5, 6]

do -> methods - these are functions a particular modelled object can do.
def take_order(table, order)
    #takes order to chef

def take_payment(amount)
    #add money to restaurant


class is a blueprint, so we can generate multiple version of an object.
class Waiter():
object -> Henry
object -> Betty

# object - # class
# car = CarBlueprint()


#object  #attribute
car.speed

#object  #method
car.stop()
